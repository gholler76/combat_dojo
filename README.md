#	COMBAT DOJO! - current ver 2.1

##	ABOUT THE GAME:
Combat Dojo is a turn-based combat game pitting some of history's most feared warriors against each other. Oh, and Caillou is one of those warriors. Yup...

## ABOUT THE WARRIORS:
**Each warrior is rated on a scale of 1-20 in the following attributes:**\
	**PWR: Power** - the strength of an attack, a factor in total damage inflicted if the attack succeeds.\
	**SPD: Speed** - the speed of an attack or defense, a factor in the success of each.\
  **AGL: Agility** - the fighter's agility, a factor in how well the fighter can avoid attacks.\
  **ATT: Attack** - the overall quality of a fighter's attack, like accuracy. Largest factor in the success of attacks.\
  **DEF: Defense** - the overall quality of a fighter's defense. Largest factor in the success of defenses.\
  **RCV: Recovery** - the rate at which a fighter recovers health during a fight if an attack is defended successfully.\

Together, these attributes make up the core of each fighter's unique combat profile.

## PLAYING THE GAME:
After selecting your fighter and your opponent, you enter the dojo to begin battle. A radmon event selected the first to attack, and then fighters take turns attacking or defending until one player runs out of health -or- 40 rounds have elapsed. Aa that point, the fighter with the most health wins.

**When attacking, the player chooses one of three techinques:**\
	**QUICK** - A fast attack that favors speed over power. Think jab.\
	**NORMAL** - A standard attack technique with base speed and power. Think straight punch.\
	**STRONG** - A feirce attack that favors power over speed. Think haymaker.\
	
**When defending, the player chooses one of three techniques:**\
	**DODGE** - A quick move that favors speed and agility over defense.\
	**BLOCK** - A standard move hat blocks the attack, favoring defense and speed over agaility.\
	**COUNTER** - An advanced technique that blends defense evenly with speed and ability. A successful counter will also inflict damage to the attacker. (In a future update.. :))\
	
The CPU chooses their technique randomly right now. A future feature is planned to tailor the CPU choice based on their profile.

## FEATURES IN PROGRESS:
**MISS LOGIC** - A base miss % for every attack, which will be modified according to attack technique, defense technique and fighter profiles.\
**COUNTER/PARRY LOGIC** - On a successful counter, the defender will gain a percentage of health, while also inflicting damage to the attacker commensurate attack techinque.\

## PLANNED FEATURES:
**DYNAMIC HEALTH BAR** - Replacement for the numerical indicator.\
**CPU TECHNIQUE SELECTION** - Logic that will incorporate the CPU fighter's profile in their techinque choices.\
**RANDOM OPPONENT SELECTION** - Let the CPU pick its fighter.\
